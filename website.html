			Re-Clip - Research Paper and GitHub Repo Video Summarizer
		</h2>
		<p>
			Re-Clip is a mobile application that revolutionizes the way we engage with
			research papers and GitHub repositories. By leveraging cutting-edge
			technologies like LangChang, MoviePy, Flask, Diffusion (an AI art
			generator), and Swift, Re-Clip is designed to summarize and generate
			captivating video content from research papers and GitHub repos, making
			them more accessible and engaging to users. In essence, it&#39;s like a
			social media platform specifically tailored for the world of research
			papers and git repos.

		<p>
			The Re-Clip mobile app is built using Swift, ensuring a smooth and
			responsive user experience on iOS devices. The app is designed to make it
			easy for users to access and interact with research papers and GitHub
			repositories.
		</p>
		<h2 id="how-we-built-it">How we built it</h2>
		<p>
			We built the app in two parts: an iOS mobile app and a backend ML pipeline
			in Python. The former offers the highly addictive infinite scroller
			interface with our videos and the latter takes long-form contentâ€”research
			papers and GitHub reposâ€”and creates short videos.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				The iOS app was implemented by mimicking the familiar TikTok UI using
				SwiftUI. The backend pipeline had several parts, it contained a
				summarization service, a text-to-speech service and a video creation
				service.
			</li>
			<li>
				The summarization service took salient paragraphs of a research paper
				(abstract and conclusion) or the README.md of a GitHub repository and
				converted it to a chunked video script. This was done using the
				LangChain library and used the
				<a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models"
					><code>text-davinci-003</code></a
				>
				OpenAI model to carry out the summarization. The summary was in the form
				of a <code>.srt</code> file, the specification for subtitles.
			</li>
			<li>
				The TTS service called the <strong>Google Cloud</strong>
				<a href="https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech API</a>
				to generate a natural sounding narration of our script.
			</li>
			<li>
				The video generation service generated a video using the narration,
				subtitles and scraped pictures from the long-form resource. This was
				done using the
				<a href="https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/">MoviePy</a> package.
			</li>
